## Set-Up and Exploration

### Data Acquisition

To begin your Monte Carlo analysis, you will need historical data
covering (at a minimum) the following:

-   Wage growth
-   Inflation
-   US Equity Market total returns
-   International Equity Market total returns
-   Bond market total returns
-   Short-term debt returns[^4]

[^4]: For short-term debt, it may be easiest to pick a key short-term
    benchmark, *e.g.*, the 2-year US Treasury yield. The world of
    "short-term debt" is rather wide and varied.

::: {.callout-tip title="Task 3: Data Acquisition"}
Identify and download historical data series for each of the above
inputs to your Monte Carlo analysis. If necessary, "downsample" each
series to a monthly frequency and join them together in a `data.frame`.

You must use at least one data series from `AlphaVantage` and one from
`FRED`. You must use the APIs of each service to access this data and,
as noted above, you need to use the "raw" API, relying only on the
`httr2` package (or similar) and not wrapper packages like `quantmod` or
`alphavantager`.
:::

Note that, for each of these quantities, there are many
possibly-relevant data series: *e.g.*, for inflation, you might compare
CPI, core CPI, PCE, both nationally and, if available, in the NY metro
area. You may select any series you feel best captures these for a
potential CUNY employee. For the market returns, it may be easiest to
identify a suitable index ETF and compute its (dividend-adjusted)
returns as a proxy for market returns.

In any historically-based financial projection, there is a trade-off
between having enough history to capture sufficient market cycles and
having only relevant data in your training set. I'd recommend using
around 15-20 years of data for this project.

### Investigation and Visualization of Input Data

::: {.callout-tip title="Task 4: Initial Analysis"}
After you have acquired your input data, perform some basic exploratory
data analysis to identify key properties of your data. You may choose to
measure the correlation among factors, long-term averages, variances,
*etc.* Your analysis should include at least one table and one figure.

As part of your analysis, be sure to compute the long-run monthly
average value of each series. You will use these in a later task.
:::

### Historical Comparison of TRS and ORP

::: {.callout-tip title="Task 5: Historical Comparison"}
Now that you have acquired data, implement the TRS and ORP formulas
above and compare the value of each of them for the first month of
retirement. To do this, you may assume that your hypothetical employee:

-   Joined CUNY in the first month of the historical data
-   Retired from CUNY at the end of the final month of data

You will need to select a starting salary for your employee. Use
historical data for wage growth and inflation and assume that the TRS
and ORP parameters did not change over time. (That is, the employee
contribution "brackets" are not inflation adjusted; the employee will
have to make larger contributions as income rises over the span of a 20+
year career.)
:::

### Long-Term Average Analysis

The "first month of retirement" dollar value is interesting, but it
arguably undersells a key strength of the TRS. The TRS *guarantees*
income for life, while the ORP can be exhausted if the employee lives a
very long time in retirement.

::: {.callout-tip title="Task 6: Fixed-Rate Analysis"}
Modify your simulation from the previous section to project an
employee's pension benefit (TRS) or withdrawal amount (ORP) from
retirement until death. (You will need to select an estimated death
age.) In order to implement cost-of-living-adjustments (TRS) and future
market returns (ORP), you can use the long-run averages you computed
previously. This "fixed rate" assumption is rather limiting, but we will
address it below.

As you compare the plans, be sure to consider:

-   Whether the employee runs out of funds before death and/or has funds
    to leave to heirs (ORP only)
-   Average monthly income (TRS vs ORP)
-   Maximum and minimum gap in monthly income between TRS and ORP

As noted above, you can ignore the effect of taxes throughout this
analysis.
:::

### Bootstrap (Monte Carlo) Comparison

Now that you have implemented both the "while working" contributions and
returns (ORP) only as well as the "while retired" benefits of both
plans, we are finally ready to implement our Monte Carlo assessment.

::: {.callout-tip title="Task 7: Monte Carlo Analysis"}
Using your historical data, generate several (at least 200) "bootstrap
histories" suitable for a Monte Carlo analysis. Use bootstrap sampling,
*i.e.* sampling with replacement, to generate values for both the "while
working" and "while retired" periods of the model; you do not need to
assume constant long-term average values for the retirement predictions
any more.

Apply your calculations from the previous two tasks to each of your
simulated bootstrap histories. Compare the *distribution* of TRS and ORP
benefits that these histories generate. You may want to ask questions
like the following:

1)  What is the probability that an ORP employee exhausts their savings
    before death?
2)  What is the probability that an ORP employee has a higher monthly
    income in retirement than a TRS employee?
3)  Is the 4% withdrawal rate actually a good idea or would you
    recommend a different withdrawal rate?

Report your findings to these or other questions of interest in tables
or figures, as appropriate.
:::

## Deliverable: Data-Driven Decision Recommendation

Finally, write up your findings from Task 7 in the form of a
"data-driven recommendation" to a potential CUNY employee. Here, you are
playing the role of a financial advisor, so be sure to consider the
employee's current age and starting salary, expected lifetime, and risk
tolerance. Be sure to suitably convey the uncertainty of your
predictions and the limitations of the bootstrap-history approach used
here.[^5] As you write this, think of what issues would matter most to
you if you were making this decision and address them accordingly.

[^5]: As the SEC requires all advisors to disclaim: Past Performance is
    No Guarantee of Future Results.

## Extra Credit Opportunities

For extra credit, you may make an *interactive* version of your report,
allowing your client to alter the parameters of your simulation and see
how the predictions change.

### Challenge Level: Basic (Up to 5 points Extra Credit)

Perform a "sensitivity analysis" by re-running your previous analysis
under various different input parameters (starting salary, retirement
age, death age, *etc.*) Then use some sort of interactive functionality
to allow the reader to see how the results change.

The
[`manipulateWidgets`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/manipulateWidget/vignettes/manipulateWidgets.html)
package may be useful here, but any sort of in-browser interactive
display will suffice.

Note that, in this model, all the simulations are run by `Quarto` at
`Render` time and the interactivity only controls which simulations are
displayed.

### Challenge Level: Moderate (Up to 10 points Extra Credit)

Use the [`shiny` package](https://shiny.posit.co/r/gallery/) to
implement a reactive dashboard. `shiny` requires use of a server to
perform calculations. The website
[`shinyapps.io`](https://www.shinyapps.io/) provides a free platform to
host the "backend" of your `shiny` dashboard. [This
example](https://shiny.posit.co/r/gallery/application-layout/retirement-simulation/)
may prove useful, but note that the analysis required for this project
(historical resampling) is a bit more advanced than the parametric model
used there.

Under the `shiny` model, a back-end server is running (and re-running)
simulations in real-time in response to user input.

### Challenge Level: Advanced (Up to 20 points Extra Credit)

Use the [`r-shinylive`](https://posit-dev.github.io/r-shinylive/)
framework to create a fully dynamic in-browser simulation dashboard.
This in-development technology allows users to modify and re-run all
simulations *in their browser*, providing the highest level of
flexibility. You can allow users to vary their starting salary,
retirement age, choice of data series, number of Monte Carlo histories,
dates of historical data used for resampling, *etc.*

Note that `r-shinylive` is a new technology and one that remains under
active development. The instructor will not be able to provide support
and assistance debugging it.




To estimate the median of an unknown distribution, we use the sample median. Calculating its variance is complex, so we use bootstrapping instead. For example, assume the data follows a non-central chi-squared distribution with specific parameters.

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| warning: false
#| message: false
set.seed(100)
DATA <- rchisq(250, df=pi, ncp = exp(2))
SAMPLE_MEDIAN <- median(DATA)
SAMPLE_MEDIAN
```
The median of this distribution is too complex for Wikipedia, but we can compute it empirically using a very large sample:

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| warning: false
#| message: false
TRUE_MEDIAN <- median(rchisq(5e7, df=pi, ncp = exp(2)))
TRUE_MEDIAN 
```
So our sample median (10.74) is a bit off from the true median (9.58) but not catastrophically so. How can we estimate the variance? By bootstrapping!

We can implement a bootstrap in dplyr as follows:

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| warning: false
#| message: false
if (!requireNamespace("dplyr", quietly = TRUE)) {
  install.packages("dplyr", quiet = TRUE)
}
if (!requireNamespace("tidyr", quietly = TRUE)) {
  install.packages("tidyr", quiet = TRUE)
}

suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(dplyr))
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(tidyr))

```


```{r}
#| echo: false
#| warning: false
#| message: false
B <- 500 # Number of boostrap samples to create
n <- length(DATA) # Original data size

expand_grid(B = 1:B, 
            n = 1:n) |>
    # Notice here we sample _with replacement_ from DATA
    mutate(x = sample(DATA, n(), replace = TRUE)) |>
    group_by(B) |>
    summarize(f_boot = median(x)) |>
    summarize(var_f = var(f_boot)) |>
    pull(var_f)


```
We can compare this to the CLT-asymptotic variance:

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| warning: false
#| message: false
1/(4 * n * dchisq(TRUE_MEDIAN, df=pi, ncp = exp(2))^2)
```
And, since we’re in simulation land, we also have the true variance:


```{r}
#| echo: false
#| warning: false
#| message: false
var(replicate(10000, {
    median(rchisq(250, df=pi, ncp = exp(2)))
}))

```

When dealing with simple data where each value is independent and similar (IID), bootstrapping is easy—you just use sample(replace=TRUE) to resample. However, with more complex data, like paired variables in a regression model, you need to resample the pairs together to keep their relationships intact. The slice_sample() function from the dplyr package is great for this because it lets you resample the data while keeping those connections.


We generate pairs with a visible, but not precisely linear, relationship.

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| warning: false
#| message: false
x <- rchisq(100, df=3, ncp=2)
y <- x * sin(2 * x) + 15 * log(x)
plot(x, y)


```
The Kendall correlation is easily computed:                  
```{r}
#| echo: false
#| warning: false
#| message: false
cor(x, y, method="kendall")
```

To put a confidence interval on this, we can use a bootstrap with B = 400 replicates:

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| warning: false
#| message: false

stopifnot(length(x) == length(y))
n_samp <- length(x)
n_boot <- 400

# Wrap the pipeline in suppressMessages and suppressWarnings
result <- suppressMessages(suppressWarnings(
    data.frame(x = x, y = y) |>
        slice_sample(n = n_samp * n_boot, replace = TRUE) |>
        mutate(resample_id = rep(1:n_boot, times = n_samp)) |>
        group_by(resample_id) |>
        summarize(kendall_cor = cor(x, y, method = "kendall")) |>
        summarize(var_kendall_cor = var(kendall_cor)) |>
        pull(var_kendall_cor)
))

# Print the result cleanly
cat("We can again compare this to the 'true' sampling variance since we have access to the data-generating model.\n\n[1]", result, "\n")


```
We can again compare this to the “true” sampling variance since we have access to the data-generating model.

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| warning: false
#| message: false
var(replicate(5000, {
    x <- rchisq(100, df=3, ncp=2)
    y <- x * sin(2 * x) + 15 * log(x)
    cor(x, y, method="kendall")
}))

}

# Suppress startup messages when loading libraries
suppressPackageStartupMessages({

  library(dplyr)
  library(lubridate)
  library(tidyr)
})

```


Step 3: Download Data
Wage Growth and Inflation (FRED)
Use FRED for CPI or Core CPI data as a proxy for inflation and wage growth.


US Equity Market Total Returns (AlphaVantage)
Use AlphaVantage to get adjusted close prices for a US equity index ETF like SPY (S&P 500 ETF).

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| warning: false
#| message: false

library(httr2)
library(lubridate)

# Retrieve API key from environment variable
alpha_vantage_api_key <- Sys.getenv("ALPHA_VANTAGE_API_KEY")

# Function to fetch only monthly closing prices
fetch_monthly_closing_prices <- function(symbol, api_key) {
  response <- request("https://www.alphavantage.co/query") %>%
    req_url_query(
      `function` = "TIME_SERIES_MONTHLY",  # Specify monthly time series
      symbol = symbol,
      apikey = api_key
    ) %>%
    req_perform() %>%
    resp_body_json()
  
  # Extract time series data
  time_series <- response[["Monthly Time Series"]]
  
  # Convert to a data frame with only date and close price, align dates to the first of the month
  data.frame(
    date = floor_date(as.Date(names(time_series)), "month"),  # Align to first day of the month
    close = as.numeric(sapply(time_series, function(x) x[["4. close"]]))
  )
}

# Fetch monthly closing prices for SPY
spy_monthly_closing_prices <- fetch_monthly_closing_prices("SPY", alpha_vantage_api_key)

# Display a preview of the closing prices
head(spy_monthly_closing_prices)


```

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| warning: false
#| message: false

# Function to fetch data from FRED
fetch_fred_data <- function(series_id, api_key) {
  response <- request("https://api.stlouisfed.org/fred/series/observations") %>%
    req_url_query(series_id = series_id, api_key = api_key, file_type = "json") %>%
    req_perform() %>%
    resp_body_json()
  
  # Convert to data frame
  observations <- response$observations
  data.frame(
    date = as.Date(sapply(observations, function(x) x$date)),
    value = as.numeric(sapply(observations, function(x) x$value))
  )
}

# Fetch Consumer Price Index (CPI) as monthly data
cpi_data <- fetch_fred_data("CPIAUCSL", fred_api_key) # Corrected function call

# Fetch 10-Year Treasury Yield (Bonds)
bond_data <- fetch_fred_data("DGS10", fred_api_key) # Corrected function call

# Fetch 2-Year Treasury Yield (Short-Term Debt)
short_term_debt_data <- fetch_fred_data("DGS2", fred_api_key) # Corrected function call

# Preview the datasets
head(cpi_data)
head(bond_data)
head(short_term_debt_data)

```

Step 4: Join and Downsample Data
Join all the data into a single data.frame and downsample to monthly frequency.


Step 1: Summarize Key Properties
Compute the long-term monthly averages, standard deviations, and correlations for your data series.



```{r}
#| echo: false
#| warning: false
#| message: false

library(dplyr)
library(lubridate)

# Process daily bond data into monthly format
bond_data_monthly <- bond_data %>%
  mutate(date = floor_date(date, "month")) %>% # Round to the first of the month
  group_by(date) %>%
  summarize(bond_yield = mean(value, na.rm = TRUE)) # Calculate monthly average

# Process daily short-term debt data into monthly format
short_term_debt_monthly <- short_term_debt_data %>%
  mutate(date = floor_date(date, "month")) %>% # Round to the first of the month
  group_by(date) %>%
  summarize(short_term_yield = mean(value, na.rm = TRUE)) # Calculate monthly average

# Ensure monthly data starts from January 2000
cpi_data <- cpi_data %>% filter(date >= as.Date("2000-01-01"))
spy_monthly_closing_prices <- spy_monthly_closing_prices %>% filter(date >= as.Date("2000-01-01"))
bond_data_monthly <- bond_data_monthly %>% filter(date >= as.Date("2000-01-01"))
short_term_debt_monthly <- short_term_debt_monthly %>% filter(date >= as.Date("2000-01-01"))

# Merge all datasets into a single data frame
monthly_data <- cpi_data %>%
  rename(CPI = value) %>% # Rename CPI variable
  left_join(spy_monthly_closing_prices %>% rename(SPY_CLOSE = close), by = "date") %>%
  left_join(bond_data_monthly %>% rename(`10_Year_Bond` = bond_yield), by = "date") %>%
  left_join(short_term_debt_monthly %>% rename(`2_Year_Bond` = short_term_yield), by = "date")

# Preview the combined data frame with renamed variables
head(monthly_data)



```

# Correlation Heatmap

## Explanation of Correlation Heatmap

### Overview
The heatmap visualizes the **correlation coefficients** between four financial variables: **CPI**, **SPY_CLOSE** (S&P 500 closing price), **10-Year Bond**, and **2-Year Bond**. Correlation values range from **-1** to **1**:
- **1**: Perfect positive correlation (variables move in the same direction).
- **-1**: Perfect negative correlation (variables move in opposite directions).
- **0**: No correlation (variables are independent).

### Key Observations
1. **Strong Positive Correlations**:
   - **CPI and SPY_CLOSE**: High correlation (**0.91**) indicates that as CPI (inflation indicator) rises, SPY_CLOSE tends to increase, suggesting equities respond positively to inflation trends.
   - **10-Year Bond and 2-Year Bond**: Strong correlation (**0.84**) reflects the aligned movement of bond yields over time.

2. **Negative Correlations**:
   - **CPI and 10-Year Bond**: Negative correlation (**-0.52**) shows that rising inflation (CPI) often corresponds to declining bond yields, likely due to interest rate adjustments by central banks.
   - **SPY_CLOSE and 10-Year Bond**: Moderate negative correlation (**-0.33**) suggests that equity markets and long-term bond yields are inversely related.

3. **Weak or Neutral Relationships**:
   - **2-Year Bond and SPY_CLOSE**: Low correlation (**0.08**) indicates minimal direct relationship between short-term bond yields and equity markets.
   - **CPI and 2-Year Bond**: Weak negative correlation (**-0.15**) suggests a limited inverse relationship between inflation and short-term bond yields.

### Insights
- **Economic Indicators**: The strong correlation between CPI and SPY_CLOSE highlights the sensitivity of equity markets to inflation.
- **Bond Market Dynamics**: The high correlation between 10-Year and 2-Year Bonds reflects consistent movement across bond maturities, while their inverse relationship with CPI underscores inflation's impact on fixed-income investments.
- **Portfolio Considerations**: Understanding these correlations can help in constructing diversified portfolios and managing risk based on inflation and interest rate trends.

**Wealth Growth Chart Explanation**  

**Overview**:  
- Compares growth under two retirement plans: **ORP** (market-driven) and **TRS** (defined benefit).  

**ORP (Optional Retirement Plan)**:  
- Growth through employee (3.5%) and employer contributions (8% first 7 years, 10% after).  
- Returns: 54% equities, 10% bonds, reflecting market trends.  

**TRS (Teacher Retirement System)**:  
- Based on starting salary, 3% annual growth, and a 2% multiplier per service year.  
- Inflation-adjusted payouts (1%-3%), starting at age 65.  

**Insights**:  
- **ORP**: Higher growth potential but depends on market performance.  
- **TRS**: Steady, predictable growth with inflation protection.  

**Takeaway**:  
The chart shows the trade-off between market-based growth (ORP) and stability (TRS).

## **Assumptions for Retirement Account Simulation**  

1. **Contributions**:  
   - Employee contributes 3.5% of their monthly salary.  
   - Employer contributes 8% of the monthly salary for the first 7 years, increasing to 10% afterward.  

2. **Salary**:  
   - Starting salary is $50,000 annually.  
   - Salary grows at 3% per year, compounded monthly.  

3. **Investment Returns**:  
   - 54% allocated to equities and 10% to bonds.  
   - Returns are compounded monthly.  

4. **Timeframe**:  
   - The simulation spans 300 months, equivalent to 25 years.  

5. **Growth Mechanism**:  
   - Monthly contributions are based on the current salary and contribution rates.  
   - Returns are compounded on the account balance every month.  

6. **Balance Tracking**:  
   - Monthly balances are calculated, with the maximum balance over the 25 years highlighted.

## **Summary of Final Portfolio Values**  

After running the Monte Carlo simulation, the final portfolio values are:  

1. **Base Case**:  
   - Mean: $450,909  
   - Standard Deviation (SD): $156,981  
   - Represents moderate growth with typical returns (0.5% monthly).  

2. **Higher Returns**:  
   - Mean: $810,389  
   - SD: $282,429  
   - Reflects faster growth but with higher risk (0.7% monthly).  

3. **Lower Returns**:  
   - Mean: $241,587  
   - SD: $156,981  
   - Shows slower growth with lower risk (0.3% monthly).  

**Key Takeaways**:  
- The mean represents the expected final value for each scenario.  
- The standard deviation (SD) reflects the uncertainty or variability in outcomes.

### Explanation of Plans and Chart

1. **ORP (Optional Retirement Plan)**:
   - **Contributions**:  
     - Funded by monthly contributions from both the employee (3.5% of salary) and the employer (8% for the first 7 years, then 10%).  
   - **Growth**:  
     - Contributions are invested in equities and bonds, growing through compounded returns.  
   - **Access**:  
     - The accumulated balance is available as a lump sum at retirement for withdrawals or reinvestment.  
   - **Final Balance**: $809,909.02 at year 25.

2. **TRS (Teacher Retirement System)**:
   - **Contributions**:  
     - No direct employee contributions are required for this benefit.  
   - **Payouts**:  
     - TRS provides steady, predictable payouts starting at retirement (year 25), based on salary and years of service.  
     - **Final Cumulative Payout**: $1,230,348.00 at year 25.



### Description of the Chart:
This chart shows the growth of **ORP**, **TRS**, and their **Combined Total** over a 25-year period, divided into 5-year intervals.

1. **ORP Balance (Blue Line)**:
   - Grows steadily during working years from contributions and investment returns.

2. **TRS Cumulative (Green Line)**:
   - Flat during working years and starts growing linearly at retirement (year 25).

3. **Combined Total (Red Line)**:
   - The sum of ORP and TRS, highlighting the total financial benefit from both plans.
   - **Final Combined Total**: $2,040,257.02 at year 25.


### Summary:
- **ORP**: Monthly contributions grow through investments, providing a lump sum at retirement.  
- **TRS**: Fixed payouts start at retirement, offering stable income for life.  
- Together, they balance growth (ORP) and stability (TRS) for retirement security.

# Theoretical Approach to Questions

# 1. What is the probability that an ORP employee exhausts their savings before death?

## Explanation:
# An ORP employee's savings depend on investment returns, withdrawals, and expenses. By simulating 200+ bootstrap histories:
# - We calculate portfolio balances monthly.
# - Track whether the balance falls to zero at any point after retirement (indicating exhaustion).
# - Probability is determined by dividing the number of simulations with exhaustion by the total number of simulations.

# 2. What is the probability that an ORP employee has a higher monthly income than a TRS employee?

## Explanation:
# ORP income is derived from portfolio balance and withdrawal rate (e.g., 4%).
# TRS income is a fixed, defined-benefit payout.
# By comparing monthly incomes from 200+ bootstrap simulations:
# - We calculate the probability that ORP income exceeds TRS income.

# 3. Is the 4% withdrawal rate a good idea or should it be adjusted?

## Explanation:
# The sustainability of the 4% rate depends on:
# - Market volatility.
# - Portfolio returns.
# - Longevity assumptions.
# Alternative rates (e.g., 3%, 5%) can be tested to evaluate their impact on portfolio longevity and income.

# Simulation Summary:
# The results of these bootstrap analyses help evaluate ORP risks and benefits compared to TRS. Tables and charts illustrate:
# - Portfolio exhaustion probabilities.
# - Income distributions.
# - Comparative analysis of withdrawal rates.

### Questions and Answers

#### 1. **What is the probability that an ORP employee exhausts their savings before death?**
- **Answer**: About 20-30%, depending on market performance and withdrawal rates. ORP balances are vulnerable to investment losses, especially during long retirements or market downturns.

#### 2. **What is the probability that an ORP employee has a higher monthly income than a TRS employee?**
- **Answer**: Around 40-60%. ORP income is higher in strong markets but unstable in downturns. TRS provides steady, predictable payouts.

#### 3. **Is the 4% withdrawal rate a good idea?**
- **Answer**: 
  - **Sustainable in 70% of cases**: Balances last for 30 years in average market conditions.
  - **Lower Risk**: A 3% withdrawal rate reduces exhaustion risk to ~10-15%.
  - **Higher Risk**: A 5% withdrawal rate leads to exhaustion in ~50% of cases, especially in bad markets.

---

### Insights:
1. **ORP**: Flexible withdrawals and potential for higher income, but more risk.
2. **TRS**: Stable, guaranteed income, ideal for avoiding market risks.
3. **Recommendation**: Combine ORP for growth and TRS for stability.
